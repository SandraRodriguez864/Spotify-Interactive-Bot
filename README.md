## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The process starts from the Appilot dashboard where tasks (e.g., like tracks, follow playlists) are defined.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot executes actions through UI Automator or Appium, performing touch, swipe, or input operations inside the Spotify app.  
3. **Output or Action** — The bot executes commands like following artists, creating playlists, or simulating playback events.  
4. **Logging & Feedback** — Real-time logs and metrics are captured in JSON format for analytics and debugging.  
5. **Error Handling** — Includes retry logic and fallback recovery to maintain consistent task flow.
